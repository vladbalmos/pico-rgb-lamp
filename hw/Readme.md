# Hardware design files

The `bulb-fixture` & `case` folders contains CAD files for a custom light bulb fixture & enclosure specifically design for a lamp I own, I doubt it would be of any use to anyone else. There's some pictures in there if you want to see what's it all about.

The PCB was designed with manual tracing in mind so the tracks are wider than they should be.
